# PCA
Breaking down a n dimension data to m dimension to visualize it in order to find out best fittable function or other regression.

In the code of PCA take the input data in dataset and choose the desired output after auto pre-processing in the code.

 **It is tested on 2.24 million 6 dimensional data's analysis for prediction using only 2 dimensions with an efficiency of 90.4% (on prediciting for 10,000 new test data fitting a simple linear using stochastic gradient method) as compared with using all six dimensions produces accuracy of 96.4% on 10K test entires.**
